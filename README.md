# Harvestr

## Description
Harvestr is a tool that helps address the issue of hunger in Auckland.


## Background

Every year, over 50% of food gets wasted or thrown away in some way. Recently in New Zealand, the nonprofit KiwiHarvest launched to redistribute surplus nutritious food to Kiwis in need.

This app aims to help KiwiHarvest’s volunteers keep track of all off the supermarkets and food banks contributing to the nonprofit’s good work. This app:

+ Presents a list of the day’s food pickups and deliveries, along with details and a map showing each stop's location
+ Provides details about all the partners (donors and food banks) that donate and accept redistributed food
+ Enables operations volunteers to add a new partner to the database
+ Allows ops volunteers to add a new delivery
+ Provides drivers with a driving route to every pick up and delivery
+ Helps ops confirm when a delivery is complete by drivers en route
+ Tracks the weight of all the pickups and dropoffs for the day

## Good things to know

Harvestr has Google authentication included in the code base. We turned off authentication as we show off Harvestr to more people. Please check out server/server.js for more information. When it's time to "turn on" authentication again, please "uncomment" out the code in server/server.js and change the buttons in client/components/Banner.jsx and lient/components/Header.jsx
